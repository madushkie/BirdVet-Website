            <h4>Dr Alex Rosenwax</h4>
            Dr Alex Rosenwax is currently President of the Australian Avian Veterinary Medical Association (AAVMA) which is a special interest group for avian veterinarians.
            Alex undertook his veterinary studies with the specific aim of working with birds. This desire stems from an early childhood love for and fascination with birds.
            After graduating from Veterinary Science in 1991, Alex worked with birds in England, Hong Kong and Australia. He successfully completed the Membership Exams for the Australian College of Veterinary Scientists in Avian Health in January 1996.
            Since establishing an all-bird veterinary service in Sydney in November 1996, Alex sees cases from other vets as well as those from pet owners. He is dedicated to providing quality care and treatment for all birds.
            Rescued and re-homed budgies and cockatiels inhabit a large outdoor aviary, while two large "adopted" parrots (a galah and a Major Mitchell x corella) share his home.

            <h4>Dr Tegan Stephens</h4>
            Dr Tegan Stephens joined us as a veterinarian in 2009, and has been involved with the clinic since 2005. In July 2013 Tegan passed her Membership Examinations in Unusual and Exotic Pets. 

            Tegan’s love of ‘interesting’ animals developed from a young age moving around the Australian countryside and then sealed while living for a short period in Indonesia.

            This interest grew leading to volunteer work at the National Zoo and Aquarium, study at various exotics clinics during her final year of university, and work with crocodiles in the Northern Territory before graduating in 2009.

            Although she would love to have a pet crocodile, a Spotted Python named Manny, Katarina the Woma Python, Becky the cockatiel, Ginny the dog and a slightly nervous husband make up the Stephens family.

            <h4>Dr Daniella Hsu</h4>
            Dr Daniella Hsu joined our team as a veterinarian in 2012.  She completed 2 years of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience at the University of Sydney before deciding to pursue Veterinary Science studies. 

            Daniella is passionate about all animals great and small. She has worked as an animal attendant at Sydney Dogs and Cats home for 2 years then as a veterinary nurse for 6 years. She has kept birds as pets since a young age and is interested in pursuing further studies in avian medicine.

            Daniella currently shares her home with a beautiful Golden Retriever, a playful mutt, a docile cat and a sneaky Alexandrine Parrot called Megatron.

            <h4>Dr Andrew Vermeulen</h4>
            Dr Andrew Vermeulen became part of the team at the conclusion of 2013. He previously worked at the wildlife clinic at the Canberra RSPCA in a position that afforded the opportunity to treat a plethora of wildlife including wombats, kangaroos, monitor lizards and cockatoos to name but a few.

            Andrew has held a strong passion for exotic pets and their welfare during his training. It has taken him from as far afield as interning at the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital to working in the city of sin itself, Las Vegas.

            Being relatively new to Sydney, Andrew hasn't had the chance to share his home with any pets of his own. However this puts him in a great position to foster the many stray birds and wildlife that come through the clinic on a daily basis when they need it most.

            <h4>Sandy Beynon (Veterinary nurse)</h4>
            Sandy has a degree in Science (physiology, zoology) and a Graduate Diploma of Education, which saw her involved in human medical research for 12 years prior to working at a small animal practice for 2 years. She has also worked as a WIRES volunteer, rescuing and fostercaring for injured and orphaned native wildlife.

            She has a particular love of and interest in birds and joined our practice in July 2002.

            While Sandy has kept pet rats in the past, four cockatiels, three eclectus, three budgies, and seven axolotls currently share her home.

            <h4>Rebecca O'Connor (Veterinary nurse)</h4>
            Rebecca completed veterinary nursing studies in 2006. She has always wanted to be a vet nurse and has previously worked in both large and small animal practices.

            She joined the team in 2006 and is interested in all aspects of animal care, especially bird behaviour.

            Having a home full of birds and exotics (including fish, budgies, cockatiels, Beanie the Green-cheeked Conure and Peaches the cheeky Rainbow Lorikeet) means Bec was destined to work for us.

            She currently shares her home with a zebra finch named Wolfgang and a baby cockatiel named Eddie.
